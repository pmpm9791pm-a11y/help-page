<h1>Financial Help Request for Medical Treatment and Living Expenses</h1>

<p>Hello to every heart that knows kindness.</p>

<p>I am a 47-year-old man living with a chronic illness. Every day, I must take specific medications to survive. I wrote these lines with respect and hope, so that they reach kind and generous people who can understand me.</p>

<!-- 🔵 جابه‌جایی انجام شد: پاراگراف کانکس اکنون اینجاست -->
<p>I live in a small 1.5 by 1.5 meter metal container, where despite my illness and difficult mental condition, I spend my days and nights under extremely harsh circumstances.</p>

<p>Even the smallest financial help, as little as half a dollar, can truly make a difference. It can help me rent a small place, buy my medicines, and start a simple work to stand on my own feet.</p>

<p>If financial help is not possible for you, I am still grateful if you do whatever you can. Just enough to feel that you have truly had a hand in rebuilding a life. Please share the link to this page with others, with those who might be able to help, or in groups, communities, or places where kind-hearted people gather; like channels, forums, and people whose hearts care for others. Even a simple share can make a real difference.</p>

<button id="shareBtn">Share this page</button>

<p>From the bottom of my heart, I pray that every hand that reaches out to me with kindness will receive its reward multiplied many times over — in the form of health, peace, joy, and blessings for themselves and their loved ones. And beyond this world, may your pure intention be infinitely rewarded by the One who created everything. Thank you for taking the time to read these lines. Wherever you are, I wish you health, peace, and kindness.</p>
